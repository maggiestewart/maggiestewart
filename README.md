### <div align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Maggie!</div>

- ðŸ“š I'm currently a Junior at LSU in the Ogden Honors College (set to graduate in May 2024), majoring in Computer Science with a Second Discipline concentration in Mathematics and a minor in Mathematics (ask me about it!!).

- ðŸ”­ I am working on a group project for CSC 4330 at LSU where we're creating a mobile app with Flutter, which we revealed at our final presentation in early December.

- ðŸŒ± In my free time, I am working on a data analytics project to track Amazon spending trends in my family, developing my personal website (in development), and learning how to make UI/UX designs with Figma.
